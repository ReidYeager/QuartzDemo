# Cherno things to look at
- [Logging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZr-53LAlOw&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=7)
	- Uses a library called [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
- [Event system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnopUoZbMEk&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=10)
	- Frame to pass data about some pre-defined event types
- [Polling events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuhNj8yGDJQ&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=19)
	- Part of the event/input system 
	- Checking if the event is true outside of the event dispatch
- [Layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kj6BSfM6P4&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=14)
	- Method to order, enable/disable isolated things that happen in the main loop
	- Can allow control how other things work
		- ex: consume input events so they don't get passed down to other layers
- [Imgui events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBP1gSbQPPM&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=16)
	- Manually set the event values for Imgui
	- Removes the need for imgui to tap into the window's events directly
- [Rendering architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPWNNmlIUIo&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=24)
	- Deciding what to abstract away from the graphics api's
- DLL hot-swap
