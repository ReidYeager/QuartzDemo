Modular components that can be included in the engine to add additional functionality
Quartz should be able to run without any modules enabled to allow more flexibility and efficiency
- ex: remove the "rendering" module if creating an ascii game in the terminal

- [ ] Rendering
	- I'd like the renderer to be entirely contained within a module
	- I'm expecting rendering to always be a part of my use cases so this may not be the right way to go
	- Though this might be another way to abstract the rendering api's
- [ ] Ecs
- [ ] ...?
