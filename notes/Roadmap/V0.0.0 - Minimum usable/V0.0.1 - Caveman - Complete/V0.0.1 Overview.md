# Final goal:
Render 7 independently spinning cubes
Accomplish as simply as humanly possible
- No textures, no lights
- No ECS
- No input

Don't fully re-write what Opal's doing but try to simplify it
## Steps
- [x] Open window
- [x] Init graphics Api
- [x] Create rendering resources
- [x] Fixed camera matrix
	- [x] Hard-coded descriptors
- [x] Cube mesh
- [x] Transforms
	- [x] ~~Push to global uniform~~ (Ended up using a push constant)
- Done! Now to extract everything into components! [[V0.0.2 Overview|V0.0.2]]
