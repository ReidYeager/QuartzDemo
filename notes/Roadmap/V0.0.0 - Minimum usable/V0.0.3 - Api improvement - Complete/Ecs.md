> Ended up using Diamond commit [b3d02f3](https://github.com/ReidYeager/Diamond/commit/b3d02f3df4b6b7d90298dbfb684fbf881a9e5994) as the base
> It's pretty scuffed, but has everything I need at the moment and I understand how everything fits together
> I can slowly modify Diamond and update Quartz later if needed

Broad-stroke goals
- Multithreading
