Implement an interface for future events to use
Use this interface to create basic events for window and HID inputs

- [x] Event interface class
- [x] Window events
	- [x] Close
	- [x] Resize
	- [x] Move
	- [ ] ~~Hover/un-hover~~
		- Win32 doesn't have a hover callback??

	- [x] Key pressed
	- [x] Key released
	- [x] Mouse button pressed
	- [x] Mouse button released
	- [x] Mouse moved (to position)
