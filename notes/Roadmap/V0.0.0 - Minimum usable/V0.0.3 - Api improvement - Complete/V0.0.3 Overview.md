Lay a foundation for clean interaction between the game and engine

Create interfaces that allow for easy expansion
- Event system
- Modules
	- "Layers" from cherno series
	- Rework the renderer to be a layer
- Base application abstraction
	- Not a huge fan of the cherno "Application" class
	- Have specific calls to `Init`, `BeginMainLoop`, and `Shutdown`?
- Imgui
	- OnImguiUpdate function called on layers

Outline an interface for all events to use
Add simple events related to the window and kbm input
Use these events to move the camera around the scene
