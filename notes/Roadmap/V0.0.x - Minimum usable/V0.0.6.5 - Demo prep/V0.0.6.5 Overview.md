Injection into 0.0.6.5
I believe Quartz will be "Good enough" for demonstration with a bit of cleaning up
Meant to clean the code from IBL testing and add some interactivity with Imgui

Want to:
- Swap between pre-defined scenes (hard-coded, not loaded from file) via Ui
- Swap Ibl images within each scene via Ui
- Swap the mesh in some scenes via Ui
- Adjust light positions
	- Add/remove lights (Up to hard-coded count limits)
